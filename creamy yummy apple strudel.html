    <li>2 cups peeled, cored and thinly sliced apples (about 2 medium apples)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>

<p><li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li></p>

<p><li>In another bowl, beat together the heavy cream, cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy.</li></p>

<p><li>Spoon the cream cheese mixture over the apples, spreading it out evenly.</li></p>
<p><li>Roll the phyllo dough up tightly, tucking in the edges as you go, and place it seam-side down onto the prepared baking sheet.</li></p>
<p><li>Brush the top of the strudel with more melted butter.</li></p>
<p><li>Bake the strudel for 25-30 minutes, or until it is golden brown and crispy.</li></p>
